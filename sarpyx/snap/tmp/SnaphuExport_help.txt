OPERATOR: SnaphuExport
----------------------------------------
Usage:
  gpt SnaphuExport [options] 

Description:
  Export data and prepare conf file for SNAPHU processing


Source Options:
  -Ssource=<file>    The source product to be written.
                     This is a mandatory source.

Parameter Options:
  -PcolOverlap=<int>            Overlap, in pixels, between neighboring tiles.
                                Default value is '200'.
  -PinitMethod=<string>         Algorithm used for initialization of the wrapped phase values
                                Value must be one of 'MST', 'MCF'.
                                Default value is 'MST'.
  -PnumberOfProcessors=<int>    Number of concurrent processing threads. Set to 1 for single threaded.
                                Default value is '4'.
  -PnumberOfTileCols=<int>      Divide the image into tiles and process in parallel. Set to 1 for single tiled.
                                Default value is '10'.
  -PnumberOfTileRows=<int>      Divide the image into tiles and process in parallel. Set to 1 for single tiled.
                                Default value is '10'.
  -ProwOverlap=<int>            Overlap, in pixels, between neighboring tiles.
                                Default value is '200'.
  -PstatCostMode=<string>       Size of coherence estimation window in Azimuth direction
                                Value must be one of 'TOPO', 'DEFO', 'SMOOTH', 'NOSTATCOSTS'.
                                Default value is 'DEFO'.
  -PtargetFolder=<file>         The output folder to which the data product is written.
  -PtileCostThreshold=<int>     Cost threshold to use for determining boundaries of reliable regions
                                 (long, dimensionless; scaled according to other cost constants).
                                 Larger cost threshold implies smaller regions---safer, but more expensive computationally.
                                Default value is '500'.
